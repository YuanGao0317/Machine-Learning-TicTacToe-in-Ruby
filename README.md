# Machine Learning TicTacToe in Ruby
This is a Ruby CLI TicTacToe game implemented with Machine Learning(reinforcement learning)

## Description
This is my first side project in Flatiron School after I learn Ruby for 8 days. Thus, the code may be ugly, and I haven't had time to refactor it. At that time, I hadn't learned GitHub, so there are no commits, but the project contents my original works in comments.
